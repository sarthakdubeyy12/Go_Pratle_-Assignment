# 🛒 Product Inventory REST API

A simple RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** that supports complete CRUD operations on an in-memory list of products.

This project was built as part of a technical assignment and is designed to demonstrate practical understanding of Node.js and Express.js without using any database. All data is stored temporarily in memory using a JavaScript array.
